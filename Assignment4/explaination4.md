# Number of ways to multiply n matrices 

## Problem 
Write a program in C to find number of possible ways to multiply n matrices

## Code
See [code4.c](./code4.c)

## Explanation 
- The program uses a recursive function to get no. of ways we can multiply n matrices
- we need minimum 2 matrices to multiply them 
- The recursive function goes from i to n and adds the no. of ways as we proceed to get the final output
